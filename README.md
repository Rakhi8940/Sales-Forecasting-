# 📈 Sales Forecasting – Machine Learning Project

This project aims to **predict future sales** using historical data, leveraging the power of **Python** and popular **data science libraries**. You’ll walk through the complete data science workflow: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and forecasting. Such forecasts are crucial in retail and supply chain industries to optimize inventory, marketing, and operations.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze and visualize historical sales data
- Understand sales patterns and key influencing factors
- Build, evaluate, and interpret a machine learning model to **forecast future sales**

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** `train.csv` (from Kaggle or internal dataset)
- **Features may include:**
  - `Date`: Date of sale
  - `Store`: Store ID
  - `Item`: Item ID
  - `Sales`: Units sold (target)
  - Optional: `Holiday`, `Promotion`, `DayOfWeek`, `Weather`, etc.

> 📌 Place your dataset in the `data/` directory as `train.csv`.

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values and incorrect data types
   - Convert date fields, remove or impute outliers

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize sales trends (weekly, monthly, yearly)
   - Evaluate store/item-wise performance
   - Use libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for plots

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract date parts (year, month, day, week, quarter)
   - Create lag and rolling window features
   - Encode categorical variables (Label/One-Hot Encoding)
   - (Optional) Incorporate external data (holidays, weather, events)

4. **Model Building**
   - Split data into train/test sets (time-based split)
   - Train models such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest, XGBoost
     - ARIMA/Prophet (for pure time series approach)
   - (Optional) Ensemble or stacking models

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Use metrics: **RMSE**, **MAE**, **MAPE**
   - Visualize predicted vs. actual sales
   - Analyze residuals and errors

6. **Forecasting**
   - Predict and visualize future sales
   - Plot forecast along with confidence intervals

7. **(Optional) Model Deployment**
   - Save models using `.pkl` format
   - Create a prediction API or simple dashboard with **Flask** or **Streamlit**
