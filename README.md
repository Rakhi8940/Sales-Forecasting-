# 📈 Sales Forecasting – Machine Learning Project

This project aims to predict future sales using historical data. Built with **Python** and popular **data science libraries**, it involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. This type of forecasting is widely used in retail and supply chain industries to optimize inventory, marketing, and operations.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze sales data from a given training dataset
- Understand sales patterns and influencing factors
- Build a machine learning model to **forecast future sales**

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: `train.csv` *(e.g., from a Kaggle competition or internal dataset)*
- **Features may include**:
  - `Date`: Date of the sale
  - `Store`: Store ID
  - `Item`: Item ID
  - `Sales`: Number of units sold (target variable)
  - Optional: `Holiday`, `Promotion`, `DayOfWeek`, etc.

> 📌 Note: Dataset should be placed in a `data/` directory as `train.csv`.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values, incorrect data types
   - Convert date fields, filter outliers if necessary

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Time series trends (weekly, monthly)
   - Store/item-wise performance
   - Visualizations with `matplotlib` / `seaborn`

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract date parts (year, month, day)
   - Create lag/rolling features
   - Encode categorical variables if needed

4. **Model Building**
   - Train/test split or time-based validation
   - ML models like:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest / XGBoost
     - ARIMA / Prophet (optional for time series)

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics used: RMSE, MAE, MAPE
   - Compare models and visualize predictions vs actual

6. **Forecasting**
   - Predict future sales
   - Visualize future trends
